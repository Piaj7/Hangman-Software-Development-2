# Hangman Software Development 2
This project is a multiplayer Hangman game developed during Year 2 of the Computer Science degree at the University of Hertfordshire as part of a Software Development assignment. It showcases the use of programming fundamentals, game logic, and multiplayer interaction within a structured development process.

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a mobile-focused, multiplayer Hangman game developed as part of the Software Development 01 module. The aim of the project was to design and implement a simple but complete game application using appropriate software development tools, techniques, and methodologies.

The game allows two players to participate in the same Hangman session. One player hosts the game and shares a join code, while the second player joins remotely. Both players see the same game state and take turns guessing letters until the game is either won or lost.

The project was developed following an Agile, iterative approach, with regular testing and refinement throughout development.

## 2. Breakdown
Everything in this project has been done by myself alone, eventhough it is a group project I wanted to challenge myself and work alone to see how much I could push myself and achieve and learn.
Everything from planning, implementation, ReadMe file, and evalutation has been done by myself.

## 3. Target Audience
### Primary Target Audience:

Casual mobile gamers aged 13 and above who enjoy, a simple, straight forward word game.

The game is designed to be:
* Easy to understand for all age demographics
* Quick to play
* Accessible on mobile devices
* Playable for anyone regardless of gaming skills

## 5. User Requirements
Users MUST be able to:
* Start or join a multiplayer game
* Guess letters using an on-screen interface
* Clearly display guessed letters and remaining attempts
* Indicate when the player has won or lost the game
* Work on mobile devices and fit the screen properly

## 6. System Requirements
### Functional Requiremnts
The system must:
* Support two players in one game session.
* Randomly select a word for each game.
* Track correct and incorrect guesses.
* Manage game states (start, play, win, lose).
* Synchronise game state between players.

### Non-Functional Requirements
* The interface must be clear and easy to use.
* The game must respond quickly to user input.
* The design must be mobile-friendly.
* The system should be reliable and stable during gameplay.

## 7. Game Rules & Mechanics
* Players take turns guessing one letter at a time.
* Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
* Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts.
* Repeated guesses do not affect the game state.
* The game ends when:
  * All letters are guessed (win), or
  * The maximum number of wrong guesses is reached (lose).

## 8. Development Strategy
An Agile Development Strategy was used for this project.

### Advantages
* Allowed constant testing and spotting bugs
* Allowed for iterative improvements of various features
* Allows for flexibility to simulatneously work on other tasks for the project.

### Disadvantages
* A lot of the features had to be simplified due to time constraints and difficulty as I am alone
* Effective when working with a team, however I have developed this whole project myself

However, Agile was suitable for this small-scale project and helped ensure a working product was created and submitted on time.
