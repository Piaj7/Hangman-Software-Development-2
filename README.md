# Hangman Software Development 2
This project is a multiplayer Hangman game developed during Year 2 of the Computer Science degree at the University of Hertfordshire as part of a Software Development assignment. It showcases the use of programming fundamentals, game logic, and multiplayer interaction within a structured development process.

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a mobile-focused, multiplayer Hangman game developed as part of the Software Development 01 module. The aim of the project was to design and implement a simple but complete game application using appropriate software development tools, techniques, and methodologies.

The game allows two players to participate in the same Hangman session. One player hosts the game and shares a join code, while the second player joins remotely. Both players see the same game state and take turns guessing letters until the game is either won or lost.

The project was developed following an Agile, iterative approach, with regular testing and refinement throughout development.

## 2. Breakdown
Everything in this project has been done by myself alone, eventhough it is a group project I wanted to challenge myself and work alone to see how much I could push myself and achieve and learn.
Everything from planning, implementation, ReadMe file, and evalutation has been done by myself.

## 3. Target Audience
### Primary Target Audience:

Casual mobile gamers aged 13 and above who enjoy, a simple, straight forward word game.

The game is designed to be:
* Easy to understand for all age demographics
* Quick to play
* Accessible on mobile devices
